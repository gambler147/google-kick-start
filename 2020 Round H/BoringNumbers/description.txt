Problem Ron read a book about boring numbers. According to the book, a positive
number is called boring if all of the digits at even positions in the number are
even and all of the digits at odd positions are odd. The digits are enumerated
from left to right starting from 1. For example, the number 1478 is boring as
the odd positions include the digits {1, 7} which are odd and even positions
include the digits {4, 8} which are even.

Given two numbers L and R, Ron wants to count how many numbers in the range [L,
R] (L and R inclusive) are boring. Ron is unable to solve the problem, hence he
needs your help. Input The first line of the input gives the number of test
cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line with two
numbers L and R.

Output For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the
test case number (starting from 1) and y is the count of boring numbers.

Limits Time limit: 20 seconds. Memory limit: 1 GB. 1 ≤ T ≤ 100. Test Set 1 1 ≤ L
≤ R ≤ 103. Test Set 2 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1018. Sample
