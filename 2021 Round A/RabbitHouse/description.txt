Problem Barbara got really good grades in school last year, so her parents
decided to gift her with a pet rabbit. She was so excited that she built a house
for the rabbit, which can be seen as a 2D grid with R rows and C columns.

Rabbits love to jump, so Barbara stacked several boxes on several cells of the
grid. Each box is a cube with equal dimensions, which match exactly the
dimensions of a cell of the grid.

However, Barbara soon realizes that it may be dangerous for the rabbit to make
jumps of height greater than 1 box, so she decides to avoid that by making some
adjustments to the house. For every pair of adjacent cells, Barbara would like
that their absolute difference in height be at most 1 box. Two cells are
considered adjacent if they share a common side.

As all the boxes are superglued, Barbara cannot remove any boxes that are there
initially, however she can add boxes on top of them. She can add as many boxes
as she wants, to as many cells as she wants (which may be zero). Help her
determine what is the minimum total number of boxes to be added so that the
rabbit's house is safe.

Input The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test
cases follow.

Each test case begins with a line containing two integers R and C.

Then, R lines follow, each with C integers. The j-th integer on i-th line, Gi,j,
represents how many boxes are there initially on the cell located at the i-th
row and j-th column of the grid.

Output For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the
test case number (starting from 1) and y is the minimum number of boxes to be
added so that the rabbit's house is safe.
