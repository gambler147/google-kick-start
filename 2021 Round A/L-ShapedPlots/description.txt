Problem Given a grid of R rows and C columns each cell in the grid is either 0
or 1.

A segment is a nonempty sequence of consecutive cells such that all cells are in
the same row or the same column. We define the length of a segment as number of
cells in the sequence.

A segment is called "good" if all the cells in the segment contain only 1s.

An "L-shape" is defined as an unordered pair of segments, which has all the
following properties:

Each of the segments must be a "good" segment. The two segments must be
perpendicular to each other. The segments must share one cell that is an
endpoint of both segments. Segments must have length at least 2. The length of
the longer segment is twice the length of the shorter segment. We need to count
the number of L-shapes in the grid.

Below you can find two examples of correct L-shapes,

Note that in the shape on the left, two segments do not share a common endpoint.
The next two shapes do not meet the last requirement, as in the middle shape
both segments have the same length, and in the last shape the longer segment is
longer than twice the length of the shorter one.

Input The first line of the input contains the number of test cases, T. T test
cases follow.

The first line of each testcase contains two integers R and C.

Then, R lines follow, each line with C integers representing the cells of the
grid.

Output For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the
test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of L-shapes.

Limits Time limit: 60 seconds. Memory limit: 1 GB. 1≤T≤100. Grid consists of 0s
and 1s only. Test Set 1 1≤R≤40. 1≤C≤40. Test Set 2 1≤R≤1000 and 1≤C≤1000 for at
most 5 test cases. For the remaining cases, 1≤R≤40 and 1≤C≤40.
